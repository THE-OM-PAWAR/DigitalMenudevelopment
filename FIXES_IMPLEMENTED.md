# Order System Fixes - Implemented Solutions

## Issues Fixed

### ðŸ”§ **Issue 1: Multiple Orders - Only Newest Order Showing**

**Problem**: When customers had multiple orders (e.g., one paid but not served, and another unpaid), only the newest order was being tracked.

**Root Cause**: The `useOrderSync` hook only maintained a single `activeOrder` state, causing newer orders to overwrite existing ones.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced OrderSync Hook** (`hooks/useOrderSync.ts`):
  - Added `activeOrders` array to track all non-completed orders
  - Maintained `activeOrder` as primary order (unpaid orders get priority)
  - Added `getPrimaryActiveOrder` helper function to determine which order should be primary
  - Updated all storage operations to handle multiple orders
  - Enhanced SSE event handlers to track all active orders

- **Updated OrderCart Component** (`components/OrderCart.tsx`):
  - Now displays all active orders in floating cards
  - Shows "(Primary)" label for unpaid orders
  - Connection indicator only shows on primary order
  - Order progress only shows for unpaid (primary) orders

- **Multi-Order Display Features**:
  - Different card styling for unpaid (blue) vs paid (green) orders
  - All orders clickable to view details
  - Individual edit buttons for editable orders
  - Proper order prioritization (unpaid orders first)

### ðŸŽ¨ **Issue 2: Newly Added Items Not Highlighting**

**Problem**: When items were added to existing unpaid orders, the `isNewlyAdded` flag and highlighting weren't working properly.

**Root Cause**: The highlighting system was in place, but the multi-order system needed to preserve the highlighting across all order updates.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **API Endpoint** (`app/api/orders/[id]/add-items/route.ts`):
  - Properly marks existing items as `isNewlyAdded: false`
  - Marks new/updated items as `isNewlyAdded: true`
  - Sets `addedAt` timestamp for tracking

- **Enhanced Highlighting**:
  - Green background for newly added items in all views
  - "NEW" badge for recently added items
  - Timestamp display in dashboard showing when items were added
  - Highlighting preserved across order updates and SSE events

- **UI Improvements**:
  - Order history drawer shows all active orders with highlighting
  - Dashboard order details highlight new items
  - Order summary in dashboard shows "(NEW)" indicators

## Complete Status Logic Matrix

| Active Orders | Payment Status | Customer Can | Button State | Button Color | Display |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| None | - | Place New Order | âœ… Enabled | ðŸŸ  Orange | Regular cart |
| Order A | UNPAID | Add to Order A | âœ… Enabled | ðŸ”µ Blue | Order A (Primary) |
| Order A | PAID, Order B | UNPAID | Add to Order B | âœ… Enabled | ðŸ”µ Blue | Both orders shown |
| Order A | PAID, not served | Place New Order | âœ… Enabled | ðŸŸ  Orange | Order A shown, new cart |
| Multiple | Various | Context-aware | âœ… Enabled | Dynamic | All orders displayed |

## Technical Implementation Details

### **New Data Structures**:
```typescript
interface OrderSyncState {
  activeOrder: Order | null;        // Primary order (for adding items)
  activeOrders: Order[];           // All active orders
  orderHistory: Order[];
  // ... other fields
}

interface IOrderItem {
  // ... existing fields
  addedAt?: Date;                  // When item was added
  isNewlyAdded?: boolean;          // Highlight flag
}
```

### **Key Functions Added**:
- `getPrimaryActiveOrder()` - Determines which order gets priority
- `getCurrentActiveOrderIds()` - Gets all active order IDs for SSE
- `addItemsToOrder()` - API method for adding items to existing orders
- Enhanced multi-order display logic

### **Storage Management**:
- `activeOrders` array stored in localStorage
- Primary order calculated dynamically based on payment status
- Proper cleanup when orders are completed
- Backward compatibility maintained

## User Experience Improvements

### **Customer Side**:
âœ… **Multiple Order Tracking**: Can see all their orders (paid + unpaid)  
âœ… **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Primary order clearly marked  
âœ… **Smart Button Logic**: Context-aware "Add" vs "Add to Order" buttons  
âœ… **Highlighting**: Newly added items clearly visible  
âœ… **Order Progress**: Visual progress tracking for active orders  

### **Restaurant Side**:
âœ… **Multi-Order Management**: Dashboard shows all customer orders  
âœ… **New Item Alerts**: Clear highlighting of recently added items  
âœ… **Timestamps**: When items were added for kitchen timing  
âœ… **Order Differentiation**: Visual distinction between order types  

## Performance & Reliability

- **SSE Optimization**: Only tracks relevant orders, not all orders
- **Storage Efficiency**: Smart caching of active orders only
- **Network Resilience**: Proper offline handling for multiple orders
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of completed orders

## Testing Scenarios Covered

1. âœ… **Single unpaid order** â†’ Add items directly
2. âœ… **Paid order being prepared** â†’ Create new order  
3. âœ… **Multiple active orders** â†’ Show all, prioritize unpaid
4. âœ… **Add items to unpaid order** â†’ Proper highlighting
5. âœ… **Order completion** â†’ Proper cleanup and history movement
6. âœ… **Network reconnection** â†’ All orders sync properly

## Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Both major issues have been resolved:
- âœ… **Multiple orders now properly tracked and displayed**
- âœ… **Newly added items highlight correctly across all views**

The system now provides a seamless experience for customers with multiple orders while giving restaurant staff clear visibility into order modifications and timing.
