# Order Modification Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a feature that allows customers to add items to existing unpaid orders, with highlighting for newly added items on both the customer menu page and restaurant dashboard.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Order Model Enhancement
- **File**: `models/Order.ts`
- Added `addedAt` and `isNewlyAdded` fields to track newly added items
- Added `lastItemAddedAt` field to track when the last item was added to an order

### 2. Order Types Update
- **File**: `lib/orderTypes.ts`
- Updated `OrderItem` interface to include new tracking fields
- Updated `Order` interface to include `lastItemAddedAt`

### 3. New API Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/orders/[id]/add-items/route.ts`
- Created POST endpoint to add items to existing orders
- Only allows adding items to unpaid orders
- Automatically marks new/updated items as `isNewlyAdded`
- Updates order total and timestamps

### 4. Enhanced OrderSync Hook
- **File**: `hooks/useOrderSync.ts`
- Added `addItemsToOrder` method for adding items to active orders
- Integrated with existing order state management

### 5. Updated OrderCart Component
- **File**: `components/OrderCart.tsx`
- Added logic to detect unpaid active orders
- Modified submit button to either create new order or add to existing order
- Added highlighting for newly added items in order display
- Updated UI messages to reflect different modes

### 6. Enhanced Menu Page
- **File**: `app/menu/[outletId]/page.tsx`
- Modified "Add" button to show "Add to Order" when there's an unpaid active order
- Changed button color to blue when adding to existing order

### 7. Dashboard Order Management
- **File**: `app/dashboard/orders/page.tsx`
- Added highlighting for newly added items in order details
- Shows "NEW" badge for recently added items
- Displays timestamp when items were added
- Highlights items in order summary list

## How It Works

### Customer Flow
1. Customer places an initial order (status: unpaid)
2. Customer can continue browsing the menu
3. When adding items:
   - If active order is unpaid: Items are added directly to the existing order
   - If no active order or order is paid: New order is created as usual
4. Newly added items are highlighted with "NEW" badge and green background

### Restaurant Dashboard Flow
1. Restaurant staff can see all orders in the dashboard
2. Newly added items are highlighted with:
   - Green background
   - "NEW" badge
   - Timestamp showing when item was added
3. Items show as "NEW" in order summary badges
4. Full order details show complete item list with highlighting

### Technical Details
- Only orders with `PaymentStatus.UNPAID` can have items added
- Adding items marks previous items as `isNewlyAdded: false` and new items as `isNewlyAdded: true`
- Order total is automatically recalculated
- Real-time updates through existing SSE system
- Persistent cart functionality maintained

## Benefits
1. **Customer Experience**: Easy to add items to existing orders without creating multiple orders
2. **Restaurant Operations**: Clear visibility of newly added items for kitchen staff
3. **Order Management**: Maintains order integrity while allowing modifications
4. **Real-time Updates**: Both customer and restaurant see updates immediately

## Usage Notes
- Feature only works for unpaid orders
- Once an order is paid or cancelled, customers must create a new order
- Highlighting helps restaurant staff identify last-minute additions
- Compatible with existing order editing functionality
