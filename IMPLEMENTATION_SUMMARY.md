# Order Modification Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive ordering system that allows customers to:
1. Add items to existing unpaid orders with highlighting
2. Place new orders when current order is paid but not completed
3. Clear visual indicators for both customers and restaurant staff

## Core Features

### 🔄 **Smart Order Logic**
- **Unpaid Orders**: Items added directly to existing order (bypass cart)
- **Paid but Not Served**: Customers can place new orders while previous order is being prepared  
- **Completed Orders**: Normal new order flow
- **No Active Order**: Normal new order flow

### 🎨 **Visual Highlighting System**
- **NEW Badge**: Green badge for recently added items
- **Background Highlighting**: Green background for newly added items
- **Timestamps**: Shows when items were added
- **Button Colors**: Blue for "Add to Order", Orange for "Add" (new order)

### 📱 **Customer Experience**
- **Menu Buttons**: 
  - Blue "Add to Order" when adding to unpaid order
  - Orange "Add" when creating new order
- **Clear Messaging**: Status-aware notifications in cart
- **Seamless Flow**: No confusion about order states

### 🏪 **Restaurant Dashboard**
- **Highlighted Items**: NEW items clearly marked in order details
- **Summary View**: Order lists show "(NEW)" indicators
- **Timestamps**: When items were added for kitchen timing

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created:

#### 1. **Order Model Enhancement** (`models/Order.ts`)
```typescript
interface IOrderItem {
  // ... existing fields
  addedAt?: Date;
  isNewlyAdded?: boolean;
}

interface IOrder {
  // ... existing fields  
  lastItemAddedAt?: Date;
}
```

#### 2. **Order Types** (`lib/orderTypes.ts`)
- Updated interfaces with new tracking fields

#### 3. **New API Endpoint** (`app/api/orders/[id]/add-items/route.ts`)
- POST endpoint for adding items to existing orders
- Validates unpaid status
- Handles quantity updates and new items
- Auto-updates totals and timestamps

#### 4. **Enhanced OrderSync Hook** (`hooks/useOrderSync.ts`)
```typescript
const addItemsToOrder = async (orderId: string, items: OrderItem[]) => {
  // Implementation for adding items to active orders
}
```

#### 5. **Smart OrderCart Component** (`components/OrderCart.tsx`)
```typescript
const canAddToActiveOrder = () => {
  return activeOrder && activeOrder.paymentStatus === PaymentStatus.UNPAID;
};

const canPlaceNewOrder = () => {
  if (!activeOrder) return true;
  
  const isCompleted = activeOrder.orderStatus === OrderStatus.SERVED && 
                     activeOrder.paymentStatus === PaymentStatus.PAID;
  const isPaidButNotServed = activeOrder.paymentStatus === PaymentStatus.PAID && 
                            activeOrder.orderStatus !== OrderStatus.SERVED;
  
  return isCompleted || isPaidButNotServed;
};
```

#### 6. **Menu Page Updates** (`app/menu/[outletId]/page.tsx`)
- Dynamic button styling based on order state
- Context-aware button text

#### 7. **Dashboard Highlighting** (`app/dashboard/orders/page.tsx`)
- Green highlighting for new items
- NEW badges in item details
- Timestamp display for added items

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Adding to Unpaid Order
1. Customer places initial order (status: unpaid)
2. Continues browsing menu
3. Sees blue "Add to Order" buttons
4. Items bypass cart, go directly to active order
5. Restaurant sees highlighted NEW items

### Scenario 2: Paid Order, Place New Order
1. Customer's order is paid but being prepared
2. Sees green message: "Your previous order is being prepared. You can place a new order now."
3. Sees orange "Add" buttons (normal cart flow)
4. Can place new order normally
5. Both orders tracked separately

### Scenario 3: Unpaid Order Blocking
1. Customer has unpaid order
2. Sees yellow warning: "You have an active unpaid order. Complete payment to place a new order."
3. "Place Order" button disabled until payment or order completion
